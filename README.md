# Dynamic Audio V2

Tired of the same flat audio no matter where you are? Dynamic Audio V2 is a complete audio overhaul mod that brings Ravenfield's soundscape to life with unprecedented realism and immersion.
This isn't just a sound pack; it's a dynamic audio simulation engine. Using advanced ray-tracing techniques, Dynamic Audio V2 analyzes your environment in real-time to create an authentic audio experience that reacts to every wall, open field, and obstacle around you.

## Key Features

Dynamic Environmental Reverb: Hear the difference between fighting in a tight concrete bunker, a dense forest, or an open plain. The mod constantly "probes" your surroundings to apply realistic echo, decay, and reverb based on the space you're in.
Realistic Sound Occlusion: Sound is realistically muffled and blocked by terrain and objects. An enemy firing from behind a thick wall will sound muffled, giving you crucial audio cues about their location.
Immersive Hearing Damage System: Loud sounds have consequences! Sustained gunfire and nearby explosions will build up "noise exposure," causing a temporary ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Massive explosions can cause a temporary "shell-shock" effect, muffling all audio and briefly deafening you.

This mod makes the battlefield sound more alive, tactical, and intense than ever before. You'll be able to hear the world around you in a whole new way.
